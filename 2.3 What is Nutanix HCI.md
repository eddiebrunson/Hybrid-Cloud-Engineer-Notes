Nutanix HCI is fully software-defined, which is required from a true HCI solution. This means that the intelligence of the solution comes from the software, which runs on a variety of hardware platforms.

There are two key components to the software:

1. Acropolis: The data plane
2. Prism: The management plane

This software can be run on a number of different servers, from manufacturers such as Dell, Lenovo, HPE, Cisco, IBM, Inspur, and so on. In general, the hardware platforms themselves are structured as nodes, blocks, and clusters.
