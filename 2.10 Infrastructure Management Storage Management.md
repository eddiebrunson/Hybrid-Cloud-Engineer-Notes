[Storage Dashboard: Overview](https://youtu.be/zsIJ98T6Qac)

The image above is the Overview display of the Storage dashboard. The Storage dashboard view shows you an overview of the storage environment, important performance charts, data reduction metrics, capacity summaries, and important alerts and warnings. If an administrator needs more details about certain storage services, then they can use the table view.

This screen provides three views that offer insight into the storage constructs within a cluster:

* Volume groups
* Containers
* Storage pools


The different views of the Storage dashboard are fundamentally the same, each view allows you to interact with and drill down into various components in different ways. The table view puts the storage containers, volume groups, and storage pools front and center. It provides a number of details at a glance about each of these components:

* Controller IOPS, total capacity, free and used capacity, status of various space optimization features, and more.
* Usage and performance summaries, as well as storage alerts and events.
The information you need from the Storage dashboard will determine which view you'll use and interact with.
