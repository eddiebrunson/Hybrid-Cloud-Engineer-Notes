 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)- defines cloud computing as "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. 

Also according to NIST, the cloud model has 5 essential characteristics, 3 service models, and 4 deployment models. 

* **Infrastructure as a Service**, or IaaS, you are only managing the workloads and applications that are running on virtual machines and containers.
* **Platform as a Service**, or PaaS, you are only responsible for applications and their data.
* **Software as a Service**, or SaaS, model, every aspect of the infrastructure is provided to you. The only thing that you are required to manage is the data. Everything else is being managed by a provider.

You need to answer 4 main questions to start the organization's digital transformation:

How do you leave traditional IT behind and become a Cloud consumer?
How do you choose between application hosts? Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, or Software as a Service?
How does your choice impact workload design, deployment, management, and costs?
Can you leverage multiple models effectively?
