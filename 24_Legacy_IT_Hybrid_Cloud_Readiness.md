# Legacy IT: Hybrid Cloud Readiness

___

Before we move on to the software defined datacenter and the web scale revolution, let’s take a quick look at some cloud readiness guides for legacy infrastructure. Sometimes, determining a cloud readiness score for these technologies can be difficult, but the examples here should make matters easier.

In the case of a mainframe, depending on what an organization is using it for, they may or may not be in good shape to make the transition to the hybrid cloud. For example, if an organization is using a mainframe to:

* Host a private cloud
* There is modern application development
* A supporting DevOps team
* If it is used for Blockchain, AI, or Big Data integrations

Then cloud readiness is high.

However, if the organization primarily runs monolithic applications with no provision for integrations with modern applications in the private or public cloud, then cloud readiness is low and making the transition will be difficult.

Similarly, with distributed computing and 3-tier infrastructure, cloud readiness is high if there’s:

* Heavy use of virtualization in the organization
* Management of infrastructure and applications is centralized
* App development is modernized
* The public cloud supports and supplements on-prem infrastructure.

However, if the infrastructure is primarily bare-metal servers with legacy, shrink-wrapped applications, or if the IT organization is disjointed, then cloud readiness is low.
