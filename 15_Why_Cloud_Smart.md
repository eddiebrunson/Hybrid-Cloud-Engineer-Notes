# Why Cloud Smart
___

Cloud First was wasteful for many early adopters.

Organizations that used a lift-and-shift approach to the process took a VM disk, a snapshot of a server, and moved them to a single public cloud. This meant that there was downtime and that they were locking into a single public cloud. Running a workload 24 hours a day, 7 days a week was a huge operating expenditure. It's cheaper to run this type of workload on-prem.

The lock-in combined with the increased OpEx required a second lift and shift, to return to the on-prem CaPex model. This wound up wasting time, money, and effort on moving their workloads back and forth. After all this, they found themselves right back to where they started.

### What needs to change?
The short version is that lifting-and-shifting all of your workloads to a single provider is a mistake. What’s required is the cloud-smart model, which the US Government advocated in 2019.

What you’re seeing here is directly from the CIO of the US Government.

1. It comes down to needing to move towards hybrid, multi-cloud environments to avoid lock-in.
2. There’s a need to address the long-term inefficiencies of migrating applications as-is. This is what caused the OpEx burden from lifting and shifting into the public cloud.
3. It’s necessary to rationalize the work and identify the immediate financial cost of modernization, so that it is easier to identify where the right place is to run a specific workload.
This is how you use the Cloud Smart model to move towards successful digital transformation.
