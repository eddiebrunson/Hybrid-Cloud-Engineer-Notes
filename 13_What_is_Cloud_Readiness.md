# What is Cloud Readiness

____

The readiness of each organizational model or technology used is either ready or it's not. You'll notice this when you perform organizational assessments. You assign every items a high or low score.
Low Cloud Readiness
A low cloud readiness score means that technology and workforce skills are more traditional. This means the current environment is used exclusively to run legacy, shrink-wrapped applications.

The IT staff managing the physical infrastructure could be siloed, based on the 3-tier model. An example of this scenario, is if legacy technology and organizational models are currently supporting IT. Or, if many workloads are running on bare metal and traditional, monolithic applications are the norm. A platform upgrade and workforce up-skilling create the possibility to facilitate cloud transformation so adopting the hybrid cloud model is not a problem too great to overcome.
High Cloud Readiness
High cloud readiness means that the technologies and workforce skills that support IT are aligned with what is required to successfully use the full capabilities of the public, private and hybrid cloud. A good example of this scenario is if catalog-based self-service is available to users.

Having a DevOps initiative and micro-service-based application architecture in use,â€‹ or containers being used for some applications would make it easy to move to a hybrid cloud.
