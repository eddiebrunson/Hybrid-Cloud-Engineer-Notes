# Cloud Considerations 

___


Let's zoom out a bit. Think about this, there are two basic consumption models: renting and buying.

Renting can have low entry costs, but higher long-term costs. These can be described as operational expenditures verses capital expenditures that can be blended based on needs usually. The business model everyone wants, is to blend the best of both worlds: renting and buying, OpEx and CapEx, to address variable and fixed workloads.

Think about staying in a hotel as opposed to buying a house. Would you buy a house when you go on vacation? Would you stay in a hotel for year? When would you rent a car over buying one?

The public cloud’s optimal use-case is utility computing for workloads which can be turned on-and-off at will.

The private cloud’s optimal use-case is for fixed, long-running and ongoing workloads. In other words, a business can purchase on-prem private cloud and depreciate that investment as a capital expenditure, or CapEx, but also purchase off-prem private cloud resources for backup, burst load, and temporary workload needs as OpEx to augment their baseline workload capacity.

Control and management of workloads across public and private clouds is what the hybrid cloud allows.
