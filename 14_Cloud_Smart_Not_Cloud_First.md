# Cloud Smart, Not Cloud First
___

The US government adopted a Cloud First strategy nine years ago. Most departments began implementing a lift-and-shift strategy. This was done to move their applications into the public cloud or multiple public clouds. We started to see this was becoming expensive and wasn't really benefitting the government very much. The way they handled moving to the cloud was a problem. The Cloud First approach is still popular, but being Cloud Smart is the right way to go.

Cloud Smart is about rationalizing applications, infrastructure, skills, and people across hybrid clouds and ensuring everything is where it fits best.

You can leverage the essential characteristics of the cloud over various deployment models by looking at the cloud as an experience and a mindset. Since everything is on demand, it doesn’t take ten hours or six months to get a cloud result. Rapid elasticity with service measurements allows these organizations to understand how well they’re managing their on-prem and off-prem resources.

That is the difference between Cloud First – where everyone starts – and Cloud Smart.
