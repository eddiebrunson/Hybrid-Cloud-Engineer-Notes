A **node** is an x86 server with compute and storage resources. A single Nutanix cluster can have an unlimited number of nodes. Different hardware platforms are available to address varying workload needs for compute and storage.

Each node in the cluster:

1. Runs a standard hypervisor
2. Contains processors, memory, and local storage such as SSDs and hard disks.
3. A Nutanix Controller VM that enables the pooling of local storage from all nodes in the cluster.

All nodes in a Nutanix cluster converge to deliver a unified pool of tiered storage and present resources to VMs for seamless access. A global data system architecture integrates each new node into the cluster, allowing you to scale the solution to meet the needs of your infrastructure.

A **block** is a chassis that holds one to four nodes, and contains power, cooling, and the backplane for the nodes. The number of nodes and drives depends on the hardware chosen for the solution.

A **cluster** is a collection of multiple blocks. It refers to the physical servers, logically associated with one another, that deliver a unified pool of infrastructure resources. It can handle the failure of a single node when specific cluster conditions are met. In the case where multiple nodes in a block fail, guest VMs can continue to run because cluster configuration data has been replicated on other blocks.
