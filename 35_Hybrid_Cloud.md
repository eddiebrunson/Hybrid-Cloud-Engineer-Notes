# Hybrid Cloud: Hybrid Cloud: When to use it and When not to

___

### When Not to Use the Hybrid Cloud

Remember, hybrid cloud is not a good fit when:

* A business has non-portable applications
* Security and regulatory compliance requirements do not allow public cloud exposure
* Delegation of management responsibilities to a service provider is not allowed
* The Public Cloud is too expensive

For businesses born in the public cloud, a hybrid cloud does not make sense without the ability to invest in private, on-premises infrastructure, a supporting operations team, and ongoing skill growth.

### When to Use the Hybrid Cloud

Examples of where the hybrid cloud is a good fit are:

* Workloads with constantly changing populations
* Large scale workload management
* Short-lived ephemeral workloads
* Dev/Test
* Training infrastructure
* Anti-spam and anti-virus engines
* CRM platforms
* E-mail
* Web servers
* One-off big data projects
