# Organizational Readiness Fundamentals

___

The first step in executing a cloud transformation plan is determining an organization’s cloud readiness. You need to understand how the organization is currently delivering IT, what technologies are being used, and what they mean for the organization’s ability to transition to the cloud to complete an organizational readiness assessment. This will determine if an organization is ready to make the transition, what the gaps are, and how those gaps need to be addressed for successful migration. It's critical that a hybrid cloud engineer understand these items.

Almost every business has a cloud transformation plan. Problems for businesses executing their digital and cloud transformation plans can be caused by their organizational models. Organizational models can refer to how an IT department is structured for example and how technology is actually used. These two models speak to organizational readiness. Organizational readiness refers to how ready a business is to execute their cloud transformation plan successfully.

Why do business think about fiscal consumption and their workload predictability? Usually, those conversations begin when a business is considering making the transition to the cloud.

The entire assessment begins with the org chart.

One of the most important parts of the process is gathering detailed information and knowing the key stakeholders early on. There are different IT domains to learn as well as what they do to deliver business services.

Your findings will allow you to create a map of the technologies and organizational models used across the organization. Then, assign a cloud readiness score to each domain. We are going to use a very simple metric to assign that score that we'll cover next.
