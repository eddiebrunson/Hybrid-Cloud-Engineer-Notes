# The Rise of Public Cloud

___

Advantages
There are a number of major advantages to the public cloud:

* It is available on-demand.
* When you do need to provision infrastructure it’s all self-service and catalog-based.
* You can provision infrastructure at massive scale.
* Low cost to entry. There’s no hardware cost and you pay-as-you-go for utilization.
* High resilience and availability.

### Disadvantages
Although there are many advantages to the public cloud, it isn’t a cure-all solution; there are several disadvantages you should be aware of.

* **Lift and shift**. Moving applications and services to the public cloud is a lift-and-shift effort.
* **Refactoring apps.** Refactoring applications for the cloud requires both skill and a sizable budget.
* **Readiness and Management.** Organizational readiness and infrastructure management may be significant issues for an organization.
* **Expensive for Always-on Apps.** The pay-as-you-go model isn't always a good fit for every workload; always-on, heavyweight applications are expensive to run.
* **Regulatory requirements.** Regulatory requirements can make it difficult to impossible to move forward with a public cloud initiative. Some requirements limit where data can reside, and if you lose control of your cloud or the data stored there, you can incur heavy penalties as a result.

### Where do you use the Public Cloud?
Leveraging the strengths of the Public Cloud means understanding requirements and deploying workloads or services that are a good match. The public cloud is an excellent fit for:

* Dev/Test
* Web servers
* One-off Big Data projects
* Training infrastructure
* Cloud-based anti-spam and anti-virus engines
* CRM platforms
* Email

The key characteristic that all these workloads share is that they are lightweight or they only run for a portion of time. Since they they don’t have to be constantly left on, you don’t have to make investments to support the workloads in your own datacenters.
