### The Prism Home Dashboard

Infrastructure management refers to cluster management, upgrades, storage management, virtual machine management, networking, data protection, entity management, user management, localization, and a handful of other key features.

Cluster management refers the overall view of your entire cluster that you see on the Prism home screen.

The Home dashboard is a summary overview of your Nutanix cluster:

* A count of blocks and hosts with model numbers
* A summary of storage
* VMs
* Hardware
* Cluster-wide controller IOPS
* Latency
* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Alerts and events
