# Capacity Planning: Capacity Runway 

___

[Capacity Runway](https://youtu.be/JkHLHWK4CCc)

Capacity planning is available as part of Prism and focuses on consumption from three resource buckets:

* Storage capacity
* CPU
* Memory

Capacity results are illustrated as a chart that shows the historical consumption for the capacity metric along with the estimated capacity runway. The capacity runway is the number of days remaining before the resource item is fully consumed. The Capacity Runway view provides overall and detailed runway information for each cluster managed by Prism Central. Clicking any of the clusters listed in the row will allow you to view more detailed information.

In this case, for example, we can see the total runway, and we can click to view:

* Specific storage
* CPU
* Memory details

On the Storage Runway view for DEMO-AHV, as seen here, we can view runway details either by usage or by storage container. On the CPU and memory pages, we can view details either as an overall view or by host.

Finally, hovering over the any point in the chart will show you projected capacity and runway information for that point in time. For example, as weâ€™re seeing here, live usage has gone up from 1.07 TiB to 5 TiB, and Snapshot Usage has increased from 124.06 GiB to 282 GiB.
