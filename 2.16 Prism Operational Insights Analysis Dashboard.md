# Prism Operational Insights: Analysis Dashboard

The Analysis dashboard stacks multiple charts and lines them up in time sync.

Above the stack of charts, Prism adds all alerts and events, represented with colors and counts. This visual layout lets an administrator click on a chart at any point in time, placing a vertical line stretched through all charts for easy correlation. By focusing on a specific point and syncing all metrics, administrators can reduce the effort it takes to identify possible root causes. The rightmost column of the screen provides a summary of any alerts and events, so you donâ€™t need to leave the analysis page.

The analysis view allows you to fully customize the number and size of the analytical charts you see and to add charts to your screen or remove them as needed. You can export each chart to a .csv or .json file.
